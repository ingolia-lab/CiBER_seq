# CiBER_seq
Code to make all the datasets and analysis for Amino-acid starvation CiBER_seq project

This repository contains code to generate the following datasets:
  -PGK1 vs His4 promoter
  -His4 promoter in background gRNA knockdown of HTS1 or RPC31
  -Synthetic Transcription Factor with promoter and 5'UTR of GCN4
  
The starting zipped file locations are as follows:
    PGK1 vs His4 promoter gzips in rmuller1@compute1:/mnt/ingolialab/rmuller1/His4_transcription/fastqgz/seq1 and rmuller1@compute1:/mnt/ingolialab/rmuller1/His4_transcription/fastqgz/more_seq (for the two sequencing runs that I then pooled)
    His4 promoter in background gRNA knockdown of HTS1 or RPC31 in rmuller1@compute1:/mnt/ingolialab/rmuller1/CiBER-seq/HTS1_RPC31
    Synthetic Transcription Factor with promoter and 5'UTR of GCN4 in rmuller1@compute1:/mnt/ingolialab/rmuller1/CiBER-seq/GCN4_CDS_UTR/zipped (This also includes IVT2 samples that were re-prepared and SF (slow/fast ribosomes from Liana's project))
